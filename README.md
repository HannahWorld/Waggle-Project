# Waggle-Project
Developed an interactive Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices.

Waggle is a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, **a fitness collar that lets owner track their dog's steps, alterts them when it's time for a walk, and even repels fleas!** Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and best of all the product really works!

The success has led Waggle's CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 *Lapcat* prototypes for field testing.
